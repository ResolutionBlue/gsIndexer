To start indexing your mod, you must first format it correctly. Instead of 
traditionally using paths like "MOD\textures\test.png" or "MOD\sounds\test.ogg", 
you should format them in context with the game's file paths 
(e.g., "GFX\map\dimension1499\1499object0_lm1.png").

Once you've properly formatted your mod, open gsIndexer and choose between 
"Automatic mod folder path detection" and "Enter folder path manually". It is 
recommended to use the automatic option. 

If you choose "Automatic mod folder path detection", it will show a list of folders.
You can choose a folder by entering it's number in the list, or by typing in the
name. 

If you choose "Enter folder path manually", it will ask for the mod folder path.
If the path you input does not exist or is invalid, the system will not accept 
the provided path. 

After selecting a mod folder, it will display information about the .gs file.

For example:

	Please confirm this action.

	Mod folder: Mod
	Quantity of files: 313
	Approximated .gs size: 27.51 KB

Proceed (y/n)?

After confirming the action, type 'y' into the console to start indexing your 
.gs file. If the game was installed correctly and there were any folders that were
not valid paths in context with the game, a warning will be printed detailing which
folder is not valid. For example, "WARNING: The folder "GAME\GFX\map\to do" does not exist in the
game's repository."

Finally, it will ask if you want to compile you .gs file into a .gsc file. Type 'y'
into the console to output the .gsc file. (This only works if the game is installed)
